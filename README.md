## Extension Settings

We registered some new commands (in package.json file), for example:

```json
"commands": [
			{
				"command": "extension.previewHover",
				"title": "Preview Hover"
			},
			{
				"command": "previewHover.newTabCommand",
				"title": "newTabCommand"
			}
		
]
```
Preview Hover is called to activate the extension.

newTabCommand is only called from inside the extension whenever a new tab must be displayed.
